# Image and Text Encoding/Decoding using Neural Networks

This Python script implements an image and text message encoding and decoding system using a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). The script is designed to provide enhanced security for your messages.

## Overview

This project showcases an innovative approach to secure messaging by encoding text messages into images using neural networks. It then decodes these images to retrieve the original messages. The script provides a foundation for exploring novel methods of secure communication.

## Key Components

1. **Imports**: The script leverages libraries such as TensorFlow, PIL (Pillow), NumPy, and Matplotlib to build and run the neural network.

2. **Data Generation**: Functions are defined for generating random images and sentences, as well as for one-hot encoding sentences.

3. **Data Generator**: The `data_generator` function serves as a generator for training data. It generates random images and sentences for the training process.

4. **Model Architecture**: The `get_model` function constructs the neural network model. It has two primary branches: one for processing images using convolutional layers and another for processing sentences using embedding and recurrent layers.

5. **ASCII Encoding and Decoding**: Functions `ascii_encode` and `ascii_decode` are implemented to encode and decode text messages into/from ASCII format.

6. **Main Function**: The `main` function sets up data generation, creates the neural network model, and trains it for a specified number of epochs. If pre-trained weights are not found, it initiates training.

7. **User Interaction**: The script interacts with the user by soliciting input for a text message to encode. Additionally, it loads an image, resizes it, and displays it for the encoding process.

8. **Encoding and Decoding**: The script encodes the user's text message into the loaded image using the trained model and displays the encoded image. Subsequently, it decodes the image to retrieve the original message and displays it.

## How it Works

- Input: User provides a text message and an image.
- Encoding: The script uses a neural network to encode the text message into the image.
- Decoding: The encoded image is then decoded to recover the original text message.
- Security: This process adds a layer of security to messages by concealing them within images.
